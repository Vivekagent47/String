# String Questions


1.    You have to output the longest prefix which occurs multiple times in the string.  If no prefix occurs again, you must output "NO". (without quotes)  For example, if the input string is "ababaa", then the possible prefixes are {"a", "ab", "aba", "abab", "ababa", "ababaa"}. We can see that "a" occurs at indices 2, 4, and 5. The string "ab" occurs again in position 2. "aba" occurs in position 2. "abab" does not occur again in the string. So the longest prefix that occurs multiple times in the string is "aba".
